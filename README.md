**A utility package for streamlined figure saving and metadata
management in R, especially for LaTeX and project-based workflows.**

## Overview

`gecko.utils` provides utility functions that simplify the process of
saving figures (specifically `ggplot2` plots) while including essential
metadata in file names and captions. This is particularly useful for
LaTeX workflows, archiving older plot versions, and maintaining
consistency across projects. Whether you are working on a manuscript,
report, or project that heavily relies on figures, `gecko.utils` helps
you automate figure saving with script names, dates, and archival
features, so you can focus on your analysis instead of managing files.

## Features

- `theme_gecko()`: A custom `ggplot2` theme with minimal style.
- `figure_info()`: Add metadata such as the R script name, creation
  date, and R version directly to your plot captions
- `save_plot_with_metadata()`: Save `ggplot` and base R figures with
  file names that include the script name and the date of creation.
  There is an option to automatically archive older versions of figures
  and save the latest version in a subfolder, so that figures can be
  easily referenced from the latest file (without cluttering file names
  with dates).

## Installation

### Install the development version from GitHub:

``` install
# Install devtools if not already installed
install.packages("devtools")

# Install gecko.utils from GitHub
devtools::install_github("oli208/gecko.utils")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Usage

### 1. Saving Figures with Metadata:

The function `save_plot_with_metadata()` allows you to save a figure
with a custom file name that includes the script name and creation date.
This improves traceability and ensures you can quickly identify figures
based on their origin.

``` r
library(gecko.utils)
library(ggplot2)

# Example plot
p <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Sepal dimensions of iris flowers",
    x = "Sepal Length (cm)",
    y = "Sepal Width (cm)",
    colour = "Species"
  ) 
```

``` save
# Save plot using save_plot_with_metadata
save_plot_with_metadata(plot_name = "scatterplot", filepath = "images", width = 10, height = 7)
```

There are several arguments you can use with `save_plot_with_metadata()`
to customize the file name. With the example above, the saved figure
will be named `scriptname_scatterplot_210920.png` and saved in the
`images/` directory. The aim is to make it easier to identify the script
that generated the figure and when it was created.

The `persist_latest` argument is particularly useful when you want to
save the latest version of a figure, want to keep different version of a
plot and you use LaTex or other tools that require a specific file name.
In this case, the function saves the newest figure without a date in the
filename, moving older versions to an archive folder.

The file structure will look like this:

    /graphics/
      â”œâ”€â”€ latest/
      â”‚   â””â”€â”€ myscript_plot1.png
      â”‚   â””â”€â”€ myscript_plot2.png
      â”‚   â””â”€â”€ myscript_plot3.png
      â”œâ”€â”€ archive/
      â”‚   â””â”€â”€ myscript_plot1_240828.png
      â”‚   â””â”€â”€ myscript_plot1_240914.png
      â”‚   â””â”€â”€ myscript_plot1_240916.png
      â”‚   â””â”€â”€ myscript_plot2_241028.png

Older versions of the plot are moved to the `archive/` folder, while the
most recent version is saved in `latest/` and can be referenced in your
document without the date in the filename. The filenames itself help you
to identify the script that generated the figure.

### 2. Customizing `ggplot2` Figures with `theme_gecko()`

This package also includes a custom `ggplot2` theme called
`theme_gecko()`. This theme improves the typography and styling of your
plots. The main goal is to make your plots more clear without
distracting elements. You can use it with any `ggplot2` plot by adding
`+ theme_gecko()` to your plot code.

``` r
# Apply the gecko theme to the plot
p + 
  theme_gecko()
```

### 3. Add Figure Metadata with `figure_info()`

Enhance `ggplot` figures by embedding important metadata like script
name, creation date, and R version directly into the plot caption. The
caption will be displayed at the bottom of the plot and will include the
script name, creation date, and R version used to generate the plot.

``` r
# Add figure info (script name, date, R version) to the plot caption
p + 
  figure_info()
```

### 4. Set the Figure Save Path for the Current Project

The gecko.utils package has the possiblity to get the figure save path
for the current project. This is useful when you are working with
R-Projects and want to save the figures in a specific folder. After
running the function `set_figure_save_path()` the path to the specified
folder in the current project is saved in the project. This path can be
used in the `save_plot_with_metadata()` function to save the figures in
the specified folder, without the need to specify the path to the folder
every time.

``` r
set_figure_save_path()
```
